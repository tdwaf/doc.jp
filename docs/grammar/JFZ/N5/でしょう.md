# でしょう

## Meaning

でしょう is a conjugated form of `です`, and can also be seen in the contracted form でしょ (more casual).

でしょう is regularly translated to **'right?'**, or **'probably'**. In a broader sense, it just expresses an assertion about something (like です), that the speaker assumes the listener would probably agree with.
