# Resources

!!! failure "Important"
    I add and remove items from here all the time. I'm finding new resources all the time so I will update this page monthly so it's not always correct.

!!! info
    These resources are the online resources I've found or are using. This will not include any type of textbook or anki deck.

    I'm also not including youtube playlists or channels as I have those stored in youtube already (accessible anywhere)

=== "Using"

    ### Grammar

    - [Bunpro](https://bunpro.jp/grammar_points): Pretty cool. Groups grammar points by N~ level or by textbook. Will essentially make the equivolent of an Anki deck in the UI. I use it more so for repetition but I learn from text books.

    ### Dictionaries

    - [Jisho](https://jisho.org/): Tried and true lookup dictionary. Probably use it every day lol

    ### TV / Movies

    - [Kitsunekko](https://kitsunekko.net/dirlist.php?dir=subtitles%2Fjapanese%2F): Probably the biggest collection of Japanese subtitles for anime. An absolute lifesaver for immersion.

    ### Browser Extensions

    - [Yomichan](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/): Yomichan is a browser extension that allows you to look up Japanese words with both the meaning and the reading on web pages with ease.

    - [Asbplayer](https://github.com/killergerbah/asbplayer): Load local subtitle files to video streaming sites.

=== "Not Using"

    ### Grammar
    
    - [TokiniAndy Course](https://www.tokiniandy.com/login): He has free youtube videos but the course is amazing. Has graded readers, shadowing practice, vocabulary review, textbook lesson and practice (Genki), and more. I'm not using it anymore as I'm following a different book than genki now.
    
    - [Genki Study Resources By Seth Clydesdale](https://sethclydesdale.github.io/genki-study-resources/lessons-3rd/): Amazing resource if you're going through Genki 1. Has a ton of practice for all lessons of Genki 1
    
    ### Graded Readers
    
    - [Tadoku Graded Readers](https://tadoku.org/japanese/en/free-books-en/): Free graded books
    - [Satori Reader](https://www.satorireader.com/): Graded reader (paid)
    - [NHK Easy News](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/easy/): Essentially a graded reader but with Japanese news
    
    ### Dictionaries
    
    - [jpdb](https://jpdb.io/): Have pretty cool features. Also cool for generated Anki decks for anime, novels, etc. Essentially allowing you to skip sentence mining.
    
    ### TV / Movies
    
    - [Super Native](https://supernative.tv/): Cool site that trains you to hear, read, and speak Japanese from TV and movies.
    
    - [Language Reactor](https://www.languagereactor.com/): Kind of like migaku or asbplayer in a way. Embeds directly to youtube or netflix (there are others). Allows you to mine from TV and movies.
    
    - [Aniwatch.to](https://aniwatch.to/): Anime streaming site (mostly use for anime that isn't on any streaming platforms like Crunchyroll, Hidive, Amazon, etc.)
    
    - [Animelon](https://animelon.com/): Can actually stream anime with Japanese subtitles which is pretty cool. Don't use it a ton but.
    
    ### Manga
    
    - [Mokuro](https://github.com/kha-white/mokuro): Allows you to read Japanese manga with Yomichan selectable text inside a browser.
    
    ### Games
    
    - [Game2Text](https://game2text.com/): Essentially adds the ability to parse Japanese from games
    
    ### Kanji
    
    - [Kanji Map](https://thekanjimap.com/): Really cool resource for learning stroke patterns
    
    ### Podcasts
    
    - [Japanese Podcast Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17P2dBQHnBnHcG3ua_24IO6sP9RDC-5b3WHV9Ri2N5qU/edit#gid=0): Has a huge list of podcasts in Japanese. There's also a list (starter pack), that's sorted by Japanese level.
    
    ### Sentence Search
    
    - [Immersion Kit](https://www.immersionkit.com/): Made by game gengo (amazing youtuber!). You can search sentences from anime, games, etc. with translation.
    
    - [Youglish](https://youglish.com/japanese): Sentences sourced from YouTube video subtitles. Great tool for pronunciation as the words are said by native speakers speaking naturally.
