Welcome to the almighty `doc.jp`! This is a central place to keep track of my Japanese learning journey (resources, goals, etc.).

If you happen to stumble across this site and find something that is useful for you, please use it! It should be noted that this site is mostly intended for me and not for a broader audience; you can think of this site as being mostly a blog of sorts.

## My Japanese learning journey

**I started learning Japanese on `08/21/2023`.**

My first few months learning the language were somewhat all over the place. While I have 6+ months of learning time, I feel like I've just started to find my footing with learning Japanese.

### Why did I start learning Japanese?

Well, I shamelessly started learning Japanese as I love the persona video game series. Persona 5 is what initially sparked the interest.

However, this initial interest was fairly weak (I liked the idea of knowing Japanese, but not enough to spend the thousands of hours it would take to become proficient in Japanese), and I ended up quitting twice before.

Nowadays, I continue to learn Japanese as I fell in love with the language (I also still enjoy Japanese media). It's a really pretty language in every facet (spoken, read, etc.). Japan is also a really pretty country, and I want to visit and explore it one day.

## Goals

A big part of keeping my studies interesting is setting realistic goals. I house my goals in a separate section which can be found [here](./goals/index.md)

## Resources

I tend to use a lot of different resources and I like to keep track of them all. They can be found in a separate page [here](./resources/currently-using.md).

## Study Plan

I like to formulate a general plan for myself in terms of studying. I will sometimes veer off this, but try and update it when I can. Regardless, this can be found [here](./plan/study-plan.md).
