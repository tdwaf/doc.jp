# Short Term Goals

## Overview

This is where I'll house my short term goals for learning Japanese.

Once a goal is checked off, I will enhance it or create a new goal (this is typically done monthly)

- [ ] Watch one comprehensible Japanese video per day for a month
- [ ] Do wanikani every day for a month
