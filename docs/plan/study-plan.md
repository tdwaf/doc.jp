# Study Plan

This is a place to formulate some thoughts on my intended path going forward (related to my studies). This changes frequently; however, the plan section will always have the date at which I updated it last. My plan can sometimes change a bit between documentation updates (documentation changes take time away from studying); however, it's typically what my current plan is at the moment.

!!!failure "Important"
    Some of the wording in this plan will seem like I'm directing the explanation outward (for external use). However, it's mostly so I fully understand what my plan is and why I'm doing it that way.

    If you happen to be reading this and it does provide some value to you, please use it. However, it should be noted that this plan is for me personally and is subject to change.

## Plan as of 02/12/2024

Working through Genki 2 and the refold JP1k deck. I'm also immersing at least 30 minutes a day (mostly youtube right now - once without subtitles and once with Japanese subtitles)
