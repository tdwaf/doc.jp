!!! failure "Important"
    I add and remove items from here all the time. I'm finding new resources all the time so I will update this page monthly so it's not always correct.

    I'm also not listing textbooks used, however, I'm currently going through Genki 2 **as of 01/20/2024**
    
- [Genki Study Resources By Seth Clydesdale](https://sethclydesdale.github.io/genki-study-resources/lessons-3rd/): Amazing resource if you're going through Genki 1. Has a ton of practice for all lessons of Genki 1
    
### Graded Readers
    
- [Tadoku Graded Readers](https://tadoku.org/japanese/en/free-books-en/): Free graded books
    
- [NHK Easy News](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/easy/): Essentially a graded reader but with Japanese news

### Browser Extensions

- [Asbplayer](https://github.com/killergerbah/asbplayer): Load local subtitle files to video streaming sites.
    
### Dictionaries
    
- [jpdb](https://jpdb.io/): Have pretty cool features. Also cool for generated Anki decks for anime, novels, etc. Essentially allowing you to skip sentence mining. My favorite feature is you can paste an entire article from somewhere like nhk easy news and it will make an entire deck from it with all the vocab.

- [Tokoboto](https://takoboto.jp/): Another dictionary I like to use from time to time. Not as much as the other two however
    
### TV / Movies

- [Kitsunekko](https://kitsunekko.net/dirlist.php?dir=subtitles%2Fjapanese%2F): Probably the biggest collection of Japanese subtitles for anime. An absolute lifesaver for immersion.
    
- [Super Native](https://supernative.tv/): Cool site that trains you to hear, read, and speak Japanese from TV and movies.
    
- [Aniwatch.to](https://aniwatch.to/): Anime streaming site (mostly use for anime that isn't on any streaming platforms like Crunchyroll, Hidive, Amazon, etc.)

- [Aniwave.to](https://aniwave.to/): Anime streaming site (mostly use for anime that isn't on any streaming platforms like Crunchyroll, Hidive, Amazon, etc.)
    
- [Animelon](https://animelon.com/): Can actually stream anime with Japanese subtitles which is pretty cool. Don't use it a ton but.
    
### Manga
    
- [Mokuro](https://github.com/kha-white/mokuro): Allows you to read Japanese manga with Yomichan selectable text inside a browser.
    
### Games
    
- [Game2Text](https://game2text.com/): Essentially adds the ability to parse Japanese from games
    
### Kanji
    
- [Kanji Map](https://thekanjimap.com/): Really cool resource for learning stroke patterns
    
### Podcasts
    
- [Japanese Podcast Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17P2dBQHnBnHcG3ua_24IO6sP9RDC-5b3WHV9Ri2N5qU/edit#gid=0): Has a huge list of podcasts in Japanese. There's also a list (starter pack), that's sorted by Japanese level.
    
### Sentence Search
    
- [Youglish](https://youglish.com/japanese): Sentences sourced from YouTube video subtitles. Great tool for pronunciation as the words are said by native speakers speaking naturally.
