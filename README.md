## What is it?

`doc.jp` is a central place for any notes or resources pertaining to my Japanese studies.

:exclamation: **IMPORTANT**: `doc.jp` is intended for my use and not for a broader use case.

## Why does it exist?

I started using various resources for learning Japanese, and it became a chore to keep track of them all. I wanted a place to centralize these resources, so `doc.jp` was born.

The site itself has evolved some, but the original motivation still holds true.

## What was it built with?

`doc.jp` was built using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). I use plenty of addons to make the documentation more personalized which you can see in the [mkdocs.yml](./mkdocs.yml) file.
