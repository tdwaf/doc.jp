## Anki Stats

At some point, I do plan on scripting this out. But for now, I'll just update it daily.

### Card Counts

!!! info "Current Daily New Card Count"
    Will do **15 cards** a day for now. Might do 20 in the future, but 15 seems like a sweet spot for me.

#### Tango N5 as of _10/19/2023_ 

**568** Vocabulary words known with 603 new cards remaining: On track to finish all new cards on **_November 29th_** with my current daily card amount. Then I'll start Tango N4.
