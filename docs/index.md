Welcome to the almighty `doc.jp`! I'm somewhat of a nerd (and a software engineer), so I created this site to keep track of my Japanese learning journey.

This site is primarily made for me; however, if you randomly found yourself here and find something useful, please use it!

## My Learning Journey

I wrote a bit about my learning journey so far. It's mostly for me, but it can be read [here](./home/journey.md)
