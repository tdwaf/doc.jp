# My Japanese Language Learning Goals

Goals are super important! To keep my learning journey fresh and interesting (and to remember why I'm doing what I'm doing in the first place), I like to set realistic goals. The goals section of the site is dedicated to this purpose.

## Structure

I structure the goals section into 4 categories: **Long term goals**, **Goals for the year**, **Monthly goals**, and **Legacy goals**.

All types of goals can be navigated to by using the navigation bar on the left hand side of the screen.

### Long term goals

Long term goals are goals I want to achieve in the far future (most of which require a certain level of proficiency to achieve).

### Goals for the year

I think it's important to set yearly goals in addition to monthly goals. That's the purpose of this page.

### Monthly goals

Of course, the meat and potatoes for the most part are my monthly goals. Every month I add a page for the current months goals. I then move the previous month to the legacy goals section.

### Legacy goals

This section houses the goals I had from previous months. I liked the idea of being able to go back and observe my progress over time.
