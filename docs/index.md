## Anki Stats

At some point, I do plan on scripting this out. But for now, I'll just update it daily.

### Card Counts

!!! info "Current Daily New Card Count"
    Will do **15 cards** a day for now. Might do 20 in the future, but 15 seems like a sweet spot for me.

#### Tango N5 as of _10/14/2023_ 

**508** Vocabulary words known with 663 new cards remaining: On track to finish all new cards on **_November 29th_** with my current daily card amount.

!!! info "End dates with various daily card amounts"
    > "End date" refers to the day where I have no **new** cards. I will still review after this period.

    As I was curious, here are the end dates with different daily new card amounts:
    
    - **10 New Cards Daily**: _December 23rd_
    - **15 New Cards Daily**: _November 29th_ → _My current planned end date_
    - **20 New Cards Daily**: _November 18th_
