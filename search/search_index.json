Persona 5 is what initially sparked the interest.</p> <p>However, this initial interest was fairly weak (I liked the idea of knowing Japanese, but not enough to spend the thousands of hours it would take to become proficient in Japanese), and I ended up quitting twice before.</p> <p>Nowadays, I continue to learn Japanese as I fell in love with the language (I also still enjoy Japanese media). It's a really pretty language in every facet (spoken, read, etc.).
