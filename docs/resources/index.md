# Resources

This will describe the resources that I'm currently using, or have used in the past. I only add resources here if I've actully used them in some capacity and liked them enough that I want to remember them.

## Guides

This section contains various guides that have helped me during my learning journey

- [The Moe Way](https://learnjapanese.moe/)

The original [guide](https://learnjapanese.moe/guide/) (not [UsagiSpoon](https://learnjapanese.moe/routine/)) was my original introduction to learning Japanese. It's a super complete guide that explains many of the issues facing Japanese learners and how to get around them. Not sure if I would have stuck to learning Japanese if it wasn't for the moe way.

- [Immersion-Based Japanese Learning](https://donkuri.github.io/learn-japanese/)

This guide was an amazing supplementary site describing the input-driver immersion based learning method. The explanations were great (much like The Moe Way), but I mostly used it for the setup and resources sections.

## Grammar

I am going through a traditional textbook (Genki 2 at the moment), however, I'll only list non textbook oriented resources here.

- [Bunpro](https://bunpro.jp/grammar_points)

Bunpro has made grammar review so much more enjoyable. It's essentially an srs system for Japanese grammar. You can learn by N~ level or by a textbook.

- [Nutshell Grammar](https://www.satorireader.com/series/nutshell-grammar)

This is provided by Satori Reader (which is included in the input section); however, this grammar course is phenomenal and has greatly boosted my overall reading confidence (which is why I want to include it here).

## Input

- [Satori Reader](https://www.satorireader.com/)

Site with amazing graded readers for Japanese. Has native audio and translations for each sentence. The word lookup is particularly good as it gives you the words definition for that particular context, which lessens confusion. Overall, it's boosted my reading comprehension quite a bit.

- [Comprehensible Japanese on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@cijapanese)

She has amazing comprehensible japanese videos. I really enjoy watching them and they've helped quite a bit.

- [Mokuro](https://catalog.mokuro.moe/)

This is a web based catalog with a huge selection of manga that's parsable with yomitan! I really enjoy using this to read manga.

- [Tadoku Graded Readers](https://tadoku.org/japanese/en/free-books-en/)

Really good and free graded books for all language levels
    
- [Super Native](https://supernative.tv/)

Cool site that trains you to hear, read, and speak Japanese from TV and movies (don't use as much, but worth keeping on this list)

## Browser Extensions

- [Yomitan](https://github.com/themoeway/yomitan)

Yomitan is a popup dictionary allowing you to quickly look up Japanese words from text you are reading.

- [Language Reactor](https://www.languagereactor.com/)

Language reactor is a really cool tool. It honestly my go to tool (with Yomitan) for immersing on YouTube.

- [Migaku](https://migaku.com/)

Very similar to Yomitan in that it allows you to quickly look up Japanese words from text you are reading. I like this tool a lot for mining.

## Kanji

- [WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com/)

WaniKani teaches mnemonics to help remember and make sense of Kanji. I totally get the dislike for this service, and it is pretty slow going (especially because I started it as an upper level beginner/lower level intermediate learner); however, I found my recolletion for a ton of Kanji increased quite a bit so I really enjoy using this resource.

## Dictionaries and Sentence Search

- [Immersion Kit](https://www.immersionkit.com/)

Made by game gengo (amazing youtuber!). You can search sentences from anime, games, etc. with translation. I like to use it when I want to spice up the sentences I'm mining (for a particular vocabulary word)

- [jpdb](https://jpdb.io/)

Great alternative to anki; however, the pre made decks for thousands of games, shows, etc. is where jpdb really shines in my opinion.

## General

- [Japanese Media Recommendation Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w42HEKEu2AzZg9K7PI0ma9ICmr2qYEKQ9IF4XxFSnQU/edit#gid=1999205540)

Kept up with by Donkuri, this is a greate recommendation spreadsheet for all Japanese media (by difficulty).

- [Japanese Podcast Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17P2dBQHnBnHcG3ua_24IO6sP9RDC-5b3WHV9Ri2N5qU/edit#gid=0)

Similar to the media recommendation spreadsheet, this one is for podcasts (by difficulty)

- [Kitsunekko](https://kitsunekko.net/dirlist.php?dir=subtitles%2Fjapanese%2F)

Probably the biggest collection of Japanese subtitles for anime. An absolute lifesaver for immersion.
