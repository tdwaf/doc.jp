Hello! `doc.jp` is a central place for my Japanese learning resources, goals, plans, etc.

!!!failure "Important"
    This documenation is intended for my use and not for a broader use case. However, if you find something useful, please use it!

## Grammar

I keep track of the grammar points I need to work on (from my studies every day). I house those on a separate page which can be found [here](./grammar/index.md).

## Goals

I set goals for my learning every month! I house my goals in a separate page which can be found [here](./goals/long-term.md).

## Tool Setup

I like to keep track of the various guides I use for setting up tools for sentence mining and yomichan. I house these in a separate page which can be found [here](./tool-setup/yomichan.md).

## Resources

I tend to use a lot of different resources and I like to keep track of them all. They can be found in a separate page [here](./resources/currently-using.md).

## Study Plan

I like to formulate a general plan for myself in terms of studying. I will sometimes veer off this, but try and update it when I can. Regardless, this can be found [here](./plan/study-plan.md).
