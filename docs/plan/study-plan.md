# Study Plan

I wanted a place to formulate some thoughts on my intended path going forward for studying. This is likely to change as I get further in my learning journey, but this is will always be what my current study plan is at the moment.

## Plan as of 11/10/2023

I still plan on starting the **Tango N4** vocabulary deck after I finish **Tango N5**. However, after I finish **Tango N5**, I plan on doing mostly card reviews for a week or so (maybe two). During this time, I will mostly focus on building N5 level grammar. I'm a decent way there, but there's still more I need to work on. The one - two weeks following the completion of **Tango N5** will be when I get to a good point before moving on to more N4 level stuff.

After I finish **Tango N4** which will take some time of course (probably like two months), I will do the same thing for N4 level grammar as I did with N5.

After completing both vocabulary decks and finishing my Japanese From Zero text books (N5 & N4 grammar), I'll begin immersion. I plan on primarily using anime and graded readers. I may also use graded podcasts but those will be less frequent. 

Overall, I will continue using bunpro for srs grammar practice going forward as it's a great way to train the grammar muscle.
