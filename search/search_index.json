I was playing Persona 5 (original, not royal), and the fact that I couldn't understand the signs around the game annoyed me to no end. I decided I would learn a little Japanese so I could understand what the words on the signs meant.</p> <p>At the time, I had no idea how involved and difficult learning a 'little' Japanese would be. I thought I could learn for a few months and be fine, but little did I know it could take years to get to that point in Japanese. I studied for a few months and quit as it was too much of a time commitment at the time.</p> <p>However, this initial interest stayed with me, and the internal nagging that I still wanted to be able to understand the signs in Persona 5 lingered. After a while, I couldn't take it anymore, and on August 21st, 2023, I began my journey for real.</p> <p>Nowadays, I not only still have that goal but also enjoy the language as a whole. It's a very pretty language, and I look forward to studying it every day.</p> <p>I want to visit and explore it one day.</p>"},{"location":"plan/study-plan/","title":"Study Plan","text":"<p>Important</p> <p>This page is subject to change (I'm trying a new format and may or may not change it).</p> <p>I also may or may not remove this page entirely</p> <p>This page will describe the current study plan I have for myself.
