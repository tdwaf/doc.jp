# Grammar

Here is the page where I keep track of the grammar I'm learning currently.

**TODO**: Add more detail on the sections in the side bar

## Grammar I need to work on currently

Working through the rest of N5 grammar as I finished Tango N5. As I wasn't fully focusing on grammar, I forgot some of the grammar points. Here are the ones I need to work on (including new ones as I progress in the N5 grammar):

- **くれる** (To give __me__, to be given)
- **以上（いじょう）** (More than or equal to, Over and above, Any more, greater, exceeding)
- **以下（いか）** (Less than or equal to, Under and below, Any less, fewer, not exceeding)
- **る-Verb (Past)**
- **～ている** (Has/have done, Is ~ing (Repetition))
- **始（はじ）める** (To start, to begin with)

### Somewhat good, but not super confident

- **誰 だれ か** (Someone, somewhere, not anyone, not anywhere)
- **より～の方（ほう）が** (To be more ~ than ~)
- **う-Verb (Past)** -> I feel pretty confident with these. Still working on the te/ta form here. Keep messing up simple ones
