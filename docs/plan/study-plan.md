# Study Plan

I wanted a place to formulate some thoughts on my intended path going forward for studying. This is likely to change as I get further in my learning journey, but this is will always be what my current study plan is at the moment.

## Plan as of 12/31/2023

Right now, I'm going through the **Tango N4** vocab deck and am reviewing **Tango N5**. I tried doing some sentence mining instead of **Tango N4**, but I think it would be better if I just stuck to this deck and really worked on my grammar heavily. I've come up with a new plan:


### What's remaining the same

- I'm on track to complete **Tango N4** in march assuming nothing crazy happens. I will continue working through that deck and reviewing **Tango N5**.

- Will continue to reinforce my grammar knowledge using bunpro as an srs mechanism. 

### What is the new stuff

I feel like I'm become somewhat stagnant with my grammar intake. I would like to change this moving into the new year

- I plan on revisiting **Genki 1** for grammar and really taking my time and working through the grammar and doing the practice in the workbook and at the end of the section (as well as at the end of the book)
    - I will move on to **Genki 2** after Genki 1 when I feel very confident on everything in the book.

    - Will likely use TokiniAndy videos/course if I feel I need it.

- Will begin satori reader stories/nhk easy news when I finish **Tango N4**.
