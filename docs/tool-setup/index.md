## Tool Setup

Here is where I will have all the setup instructions/guides for the tools I use frequently. That way I can always keep track If I build a new computer/format my hard drives or if I need it on a secondary computer

## Current Guides 

Here are the current pages although they aren't up to date. Will update them once I actually begin mining

- **Mining**: [Sentence Mining](mining.md)
- **Yomichan**: [Yomichan](yomichan.md)
