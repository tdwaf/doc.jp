## What is it?

`doc.jp` is a central place for any notes or resources pertaining to my Japanese studies.

:exclamation: **IMPORTANT**: `doc.jp` is intended for my use and not for a broader use case.

## Why does it exist?

I was originally using obsidian to organize my notes, but this quickly became an issue when I went on a business trip and didn't have access to my notes.

The solution was to either use an online notebook service like `notion` or `evernote`, or just make my own documentation site. I chose to make my own documentation site as I won't ever have to worry about my notes being lost.

## What was it built with?

`doc.jp` was built using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). I use plenty of addons to make the documentation more personalized which you can see in the [mkdocs.yml](./mkdocs.yml) file.

## Information pertaining to my Japanese learning journey

### When did I start learning Japanese?

I started learning Japanese seriously on `08/21/2023`.

### Why did I start learning Japanese?

As cliche as this is going to sound, I think the biggest reason I want to learn Japanese is because I want to live a life without regrets.

I've always been enamoured by the Japanese language. Japan is a beautiful country with a beautiful language. I think I really got into Japanese after playing `persona 5` for the first time when it came out. The aesthetic of Japan was alluring and I started to get really into Japanese music and food. From there I started to watch anime, and my love for Japan grew even further. Obviously, that translated into me wanting to learn Japanese, although I was never super invested in learning the language.

I turn 30 in four years (less now). I can't believe I'm more than half way through my 20s. I've done so much with my life: I've travelled all over the united states in a van, obtained a bachelors degree, got engaged. But there's something that's always nagged me in the back of my subconscious. When I search deep within myself, Japanese always peers back at me.

I don't want to turn 30 without learning Japanese in some capacity. That's not gonna happen. I guess this is why I'm learning Japanese: It's something I've wanted to do for a long time and there's no possible way I'm not gonna learn it.
