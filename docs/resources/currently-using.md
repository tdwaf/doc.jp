!!! failure "Important"
    I add and remove items from here all the time. I'm finding new resources all the time so I will update this page monthly so it's not always correct.


### Grammar

- **Genki 1**: Grammar textbook

- [Bunpro](https://bunpro.jp/grammar_points): Pretty cool. Groups grammar points by N~ level or by textbook. Will essentially make the equivolent of an Anki deck in the UI. I use it more so for repetition but I learn from text books.

### Dictionaries

- [Jotoba](https://jotoba.de/): A really helpful dictionary I prefer over Jisho

- [Jisho](https://jisho.org/): Tried and true lookup dictionary

- [Tokoboto](https://takoboto.jp/): Another dictionary I like to use from time to time. Not as much as the other two however

### Browser Extensions

- [Yomichan](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/): Yomichan is a browser extension that allows you to look up Japanese words with both the meaning and the reading on web pages with ease.
