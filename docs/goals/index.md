# My Japanese Language Learning Goals

The way I organize and keep track of my goals has changed over time. I used to make a new document for each month of a particular year; however, this became far too tedious as the goals were relatively similar. I now have a file for short term and long term goals which makes my life much simpler; however, I still like to revise and ensure my goals are still accurate every month (for short term).

- **Short Term** goals are likely to change frequently (if not every month). I keep track of my current short term goals in the [Short Term Goals](./short-term.md) file.

- **Long Term** goals are unlikely to change frequently. I typically review these once a year to ensure they're still accurate (this isn't a hard rule, but it's what I typically do). I keep track of my current long term goals in the [Long Term Goals](./long-term.md) file.

## Why do I have these?

When I began studying Japanese, I had a goal in mind. Of course, my 'motivations' changed over time; however, continuing to have goals makes the learning process much more fun. It provides something to strive for.

I don't necessarily 'need' them as I have a daily routine that I do no matter what. But it's nice to have something to work towards (makes the learning process more rewarding)
