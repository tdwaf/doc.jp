!!! failure "Important"
    I add and remove items from here all the time. I'm finding new resources all the time so I will update this page monthly so it's not always correct.

### Browser Extensions

- [Yomitan](https://github.com/themoeway/yomitan): Yomitan is a browser extension that allows you to look up Japanese words with both the meaning and the reading on web pages with ease. I use it primarily for quickly looking up definitions (not for mining) when I'm reading.

- [Migaku](https://migaku.com/): Honestly, it's mostly just a sentence mining thing for me. I prefer it over using yomitan and asbplayer. Might change in the future though.

- [Language Reactor](https://www.languagereactor.com/): Kind of like migaku or yomitan in a way. Embeds directly to youtube or netflix (there are others). I like it for just reading subtitles on youtube and not for mining (I like reading subtitles with this on youtube better than yomitan as there's a list of all the subtiles in a panel on the right similar to asbplayer).

### Grammar

- Genki 2 (Grammar textbook)

- [Bunpro](https://bunpro.jp/grammar_points): Pretty cool. Groups grammar points by N~ level or by textbook. Will essentially make the equivalent of an Anki deck in the UI. I use it more so for repetition but I learn from textbooks.

### Input

- [Mokuro](https://catalog.mokuro.moe/): This is a web based catalog with a huge selection of manga that's parsable with yomitan! I really enjoy using this to read manga.

- [Satori Reader](https://www.satorireader.com/): I really like this service. It essentially just a site with tons of graded stories. However, the sentence by sentence translation and native audio make the whole service very nice to use.

- [Comprehensible Japanese on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@cijapanese): She has amazing comprehensible japanese videos. I really enjoy watching them and they've helped quite a bit.

- [Akiko Japanese Conversations on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Aki-SenseiJPN): Another great channel with really good comprehensible japanese.

### Dictionaries

- [Jotoba](https://jotoba.de/): A really helpful dictionary I prefer over Jisho at times.

- [Jisho](https://jisho.org/): Tried and true lookup dictionary.

### Sentence Search

- [Immersion Kit](https://www.immersionkit.com/): Made by game gengo (amazing youtuber!). You can search sentences from anime, games, etc. with translation. I like to use it when I want to spice up the sentences I'm mining (for a particular vocabulary word)

### Misc

- [Japanese Media Recommendation Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w42HEKEu2AzZg9K7PI0ma9ICmr2qYEKQ9IF4XxFSnQU/edit#gid=1999205540): This has been super helpful when picking resources to get input from
