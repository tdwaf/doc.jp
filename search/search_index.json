Japan is a beautiful country with a beautiful language. I think I really got into Japanese after playing <code>persona 5</code> for the first time when it came out. The aesthetic of Japan was alluring and I started to get really into Japanese music and food. From there I started to watch anime, and my love for Japan grew even further. Obviously, that translated into me wanting to learn Japanese, although I was never super invested in learning the language.</p> <p>I turn 30 in four years (less now). I can't believe I'm more than half way through my 20s. I've done so much with my life: I've travelled all over the united states in a van, obtained a bachelors degree, got engaged. But there's something that's always nagged me in the back of my subconscious. When I search deep within myself, Japanese always peers back at me.</p> <p>I don't want to turn 30 without learning Japanese in some capacity. That's not gonna happen. I guess this is why I'm learning Japanese: It's something I've wanted to do for a long time and there's no possible way I'm not gonna learn it.</p>"},{"location":"plan/study-plan/","title":"Study Plan","text":"<p>I wanted a place to formulate some thoughts on my intended path going forward for studying.

However, after I finish Tango N5, I plan on doing mostly card reviews for a week or so (maybe two). During this time, I will mostly focus on building N5 level grammar. I'm a decent way there, but there's still more I need to work on. The one - two weeks following the completion of Tango N5 will be when I get to a good point before moving on to more N4 level stuff.</p> <p>After I finish Tango N4 which will take some time of course (probably like two months), I will do the same thing for N4 level grammar as I did with N5.</p> <p>After completing both vocabulary decks and finishing my Japanese From Zero text books (N5 &amp; N4 grammar), I'll begin immersion. I plan on primarily using anime and graded readers. I may also use graded podcasts but those will be less frequent. </p> <p>Overall, I will continue using bunpro for srs grammar practice going forward as it's a great way to train the grammar muscle.</p>"},{"location":"resources/currently-using/","title":"Currently Using","text":"<p>Important</p> <p>I add and remove items from here all the time.
