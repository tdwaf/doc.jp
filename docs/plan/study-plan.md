# Study Plan

!!!failure "Important"
    This page is subject to change (I'm trying a new format and may or may not change it).

    I also may or may not remove this page entirely


This page will describe the current study plan I have for myself. This isn't going to be super detailed, but will list my current flow.

- Start my morning with new vocab and reviews using the Kaishi Anki deck
- Do my bunpro grammar reviews and add a new grammar point to review (either from bunrpo or genki 2)
- Do my WaniKani reviews (or new cards once a week)
- Do one or two Grammar Nutshell lessons (from satori reader)
- Immerse using at least one Comprehensible Japanese video (youtube)
