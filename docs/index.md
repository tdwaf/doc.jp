# doc.jp Landing Page

Hello! `doc.jp` is a central place where I can keep track of grammar and other Japanese learning resources and notes.

!!!warning "Important"
    This documenation is intended for my use and not for a broader use case. However, if you find something useful, please use it!

## Anki Stats

I primarily use Anki for vocabulary srs repitition. In the future I might use something like `jpdb`, but for now I use Anki. 

I display all my stats for the various decks I'm actively studying/reviewing in the [stats](./stats/stats.md) page on this documentation site.

## Grammar

For grammar related notes, I house those in the [grammar](./grammar/home.md) section on this documentation site.
