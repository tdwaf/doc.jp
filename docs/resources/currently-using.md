!!! failure "Important"
    I add and remove items from here all the time. I'm finding new resources all the time so I will update this page monthly so it's not always correct.

!!! info
    These resources are the online resources I've found or are using. This will not include any type of textbook or anki deck.

    I'm also not including youtube playlists or channels as I have those stored in youtube already (accessible anywhere)


### Grammar

- [Bunpro](https://bunpro.jp/grammar_points): Pretty cool. Groups grammar points by N~ level or by textbook. Will essentially make the equivolent of an Anki deck in the UI. I use it more so for repetition but I learn from text books.

### Dictionaries

- [Jisho](https://jisho.org/): Tried and true lookup dictionary. Probably use it every day lol

### TV / Movies

- [Aniwatch.to](https://aniwatch.to/): Anime streaming site (mostly use for anime that isn't on any streaming platforms like Crunchyroll, Hidive, Amazon, etc.)

- [Aniwave.to](https://aniwave.to/): Anime streaming site (mostly use for anime that isn't on any streaming platforms like Crunchyroll, Hidive, Amazon, etc.)

### Browser Extensions

- [Yomichan](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/): Yomichan is a browser extension that allows you to look up Japanese words with both the meaning and the reading on web pages with ease.
