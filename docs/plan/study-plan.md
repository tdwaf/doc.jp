# Study Plan

This is a place to formulate some thoughts on my intended path going forward (related to my studies). This changes frequently; however, the plan section will always have the date at which I updated it last. My plan can sometimes change a bit between documentation updates (documentation changes take time away from studying); however, it's typically what my current plan is at the moment.

!!!failure "Important"
    Some of the wording in this plan will seem like I'm directing the explanation outward (for external use). However, it's mostly so I fully understand what my plan is and why I'm doing it that way.

    If you happen to be reading this and it does provide some value to you, please use it. However, it should be noted that this plan is for me personally and is subject to change.

## Plan as of 01/20/2024

Okay, I couldn't continue the tango anki grind. The **Tango N4** vocab deck was just too stale for me for whatever reason. Because of this, I'm changing up the plan a bit.

### What's remaining the same

- Will continue to review the **Tango N5** anki deck.

- Will continue to reinforce my grammar knowledge using bunpro as an srs mechanism. 

- Will continue to go through the Genki series

### What is the new stuff

It's time to begin really ingesting Japanese media in Japanese! I'm going to begin actually immersing and mining vocabulary (and refining grammar) with my immersion.

**Initially, I will focus a bit on just going through satori reader stories**. There's a few reasons for this:

- I want to ease myself in and not feel overwhelmed.
- Satori Reader builds up vocabulary gradually, meaning I wouldn't have to mine every single word all the time (for a while).

**What is the intended way of studying through satori reader?**

1. Firstly, I will read through the story, only clicking on words I don't recognize. I will then try and translate the sentence based on what I believe the sentence means. I won't look at the full translation of the sentence the first time I read it, as I want to challenge myself a bit.

2. Secondly, I will go through the story a second time, somewhat replicating the steps in the first read-through. However, during this read-through, I will look at the sentence translations and mine any vocabulary words I don't know.

3. Lastly, I will go through the story once more, although this time I will listen to it using the native audio provided on Satori Reader stories.

**You may be wondering**, this seems quite verbose. Why are you going through all those steps every time you read a story? Well, I found this method works the best and leads to the most satisfaction on my end.

- By reading through the story once without mining anything and without looking at the translation, I can feel like I'm actually making progress in the story (the stories are very difficult to understand when you first start). Then, I can follow that up by actually doing the mining.
