Obviously, that translated into me wanting to learn Japanese, although I was never super invested in learning the language.</p> <p>I turn 30 in four years (less now). I can't believe I'm more than half way through my 20s. I've done so much with my life: I've travelled all over the united states in a van, obtained a bachelors degree, got engaged. But there's something that's always nagged me in the back of my subconscious. When I search deep within myself, Japanese always peers back at me.</p> <p>I don't want to turn 30 without learning Japanese in some capacity. That's not gonna happen.
