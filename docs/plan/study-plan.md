# Study Plan

I wanted a place to formulate some thoughts on my intended path going forward for studying. This is likely to change as I get further in my learning journey, but this is will always be what my current study plan is at the moment.

## Plan

The general plan will be to learn vocabulary simultaneously with grammar up until around the N4 level (by the textbook standards). For vocabulary, I'll be using the `Tango N5` Anki Deck and will start the `Tango N4` Anki Deck after finishing `N5`. For grammar, I'll be using `Genki` or `JFZ` and will stop after `Genki 2` or `JFZ 5`.

After finishing the resources above, I'll begin starting immersion to actually apply what I've learned. I plan on immersing with anime, podcasts, and graded readers. There are also simple manga that will be part of my reading practice as well. The idea is that I'll be learning new grammar points as I interact with the language natively now that I have a solid foundation with vocabulary and grammar. I'll also start making my own Anki Decks from my immersion instead of using pre-made vocabulary decks. I'll likely continue using bunpro to keep track of grammar points in an srs way going forward.

## What am I aiming for at the moment?

Right now, I would love to be able to read NHK Easy News or stories in satori reader. At the moment, it's a bit difficult and annoying but will get better with practice. 

I would also like to eventually take the JLPT N3 (for personal achievement reasons), so all my studies will also be used for this purpose.
