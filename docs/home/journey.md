# My Japanese learning journey

**I started seriously learning Japanese on `08/21/2023`.**

## Why did I start learning Japanese?

My initial reasoning for learning Japanese is somewhat random. I was playing Persona 5 (original, not royal), and the fact that I couldn't understand the signs around the game annoyed me to no end. I decided I would learn a little Japanese so I could understand what the words on the signs meant.

At the time, I had no idea how involved and difficult learning a 'little' Japanese would be. I thought I could learn for a few months and be fine, but little did I know it could take years to get to that point in Japanese. I studied for a few months and quit as it was too much of a time commitment at the time.

However, this initial interest stayed with me, and the internal nagging that I still wanted to be able to understand the signs in Persona 5 lingered. After a while, I couldn't take it anymore, and on August 21st, 2023, I began my journey for real.

Nowadays, I not only still have that goal but also enjoy the language as a whole. It's a very pretty language, and I look forward to studying it every day.

I want to visit and explore it one day.
