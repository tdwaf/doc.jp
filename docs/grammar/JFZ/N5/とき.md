# とき

## Using とき to say "when"

とき can be used in several ways to describe a situation. It can come after verbs and adjectives, and can be linked to other words using the の particle. When used with verbs, the verb tense doesn't matter, but the verb must be in the dictionary form. If you are talking about a specific time, then the time marker に is used after とき.
