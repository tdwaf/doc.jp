# Study Plan

!!!failure "Important"
    This page is subject to change (I'm trying a new format and may or may not change it).

    I also may or may not remove this page entirely


This page will describe the current study plan I have for myself. This isn't going to be super detailed, but will list my current flow.

- Anki Kaishi deck
- Bunpro grammar review (will add a new one from here or from Genki 2)
- WaniKani lesson and review
- Satori Reader Grammar Nutshell lesson (sometimes two)
- Immerse in comprehensible Japanese video
