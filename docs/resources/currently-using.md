!!! failure "Important"
    I add and remove items from here all the time. I'm finding new resources all the time so I will update this page monthly so it's not always correct.

    I'm also not listing textbooks used, however, I'm currently going through Genki 2 **as of 01/20/2024**

### Browser Extensions

- [Yomitan](https://github.com/themoeway/yomitan): Yomitan is a browser extension that allows you to look up Japanese words with both the meaning and the reading on web pages with ease. I pretty much just use it for the definitions of things when migaku isn't turned on.

- [Migaku](https://migaku.com/): Honestly, it's mostly just a sentence mining thing for me. I prefer it over using yomitan and asbplayer. Might change in the future though.

- [Language Reactor](https://www.languagereactor.com/): Kind of like migaku or asbplayer in a way. Embeds directly to youtube or netflix (there are others). Allows you to mine from TV and movies.

### Graded Readers

- [Satori Reader](https://www.satorireader.com/): I really like this service. It essentially just a site with tons of graded stories. However, the sentence by sentence translation and native audio make the whole service very nice to use.

### Grammar

- [Bunpro](https://bunpro.jp/grammar_points): Pretty cool. Groups grammar points by N~ level or by textbook. Will essentially make the equivolent of an Anki deck in the UI. I use it more so for repetition but I learn from text books.

- [TokiniAndy Course](https://www.tokiniandy.com/login): He has free youtube videos but the course is amazing. Has graded readers, shadowing practice, vocabulary review, textbook lesson and practice (Genki), and more. I'm not using it anymore as I'm following a different book than genki now.

### Dictionaries

- [Jotoba](https://jotoba.de/): A really helpful dictionary I prefer over Jisho at times.

- [Jisho](https://jisho.org/): Tried and true lookup dictionary.

### Sentence Search

- [Immersion Kit](https://www.immersionkit.com/): Made by game gengo (amazing youtuber!). You can search sentences from anime, games, etc. with translation. I like to use it when I want to spice up the sentences I'm mining (for a particular vocabulary word)
