# Home

Welcome to the almighty `doc.jp`! I'm somewhat of a nerd (and a software engineer), so I created this site to keep track of my Japanese learning journey.

This site is primarily made for me; however, if you randomly found yourself here and find something useful, please use it!

## My Learning Journey

I wrote a bit about my learning journey so far. It's mostly for me, but it can be read [here](./home/journey.md)

## Goals

A big part of keeping my studies interesting is setting realistic goals. I house my goals in a separate section which can be found [here](./goals/index.md)

## Resources

I tend to use a lot of different resources and I like to keep track of them all. They can be found in a separate page [here](./resources/currently-using.md).

## Study Plan

I like to formulate a general plan for myself in terms of studying. I will sometimes veer off this, but try and update it when I can. Regardless, this can be found [here](./plan/study-plan.md).
