# Yomichan Setup

When searching for ways to start mining sentences from anime, yomichan was the resource the I used the most.

## Guides

I followed two guides (one for yomichan itself as I think it's a bit clearer, and one for setting up yomichan for mining)

- [JP Mining Note](https://aquafina-water-bottle.github.io/jp-mining-note/setupyomichan/#overview): For mining
- [TheMoeWay](https://learnjapanese.moe/yomichan/): For general Yomichan setup (dictionaries, etc.)
